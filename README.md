# Todo-using-React
About the Project
In this project I made a TodoApp as instructed in the assignment, with proper frontend, state management. I also did the bonus tasks of persistent data storage to store the data even when the page is refreshed and the ability to mark the tasks as complete without deleting it.

Installation Directions:
First clone the repository, then run the following commands in your terminal

npm i
followed by

npm run dev
